              Hello there, my name is Scott Daniels, and welcome to my portfolio! I'd like to take a moment to tell you
              a little bit
              about
              myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              With regard to my professional career, I currently work for a utility company as a Firewall
              Administrator.
              I have been there for a little over a year, and have spent a significant time scripting and automating
              operational tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before that I worked for the local municipality, during my time there, I worked
              on the Network Operations team. I rose through the ranks from being a Junior Network Engineer up to the
              title of Sr.
              Network Architect.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm currently pursuing Web Development in order to broaden my skillset and build out
              custom tools in the form of web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              With regard to my personal life, I was recently married in November of 2018. My wife and I have two cats,
              Hank
              and Penny. They are both completely spoiled. I'm also a massive Liverpool Fan. When I'm not in class or
              work, on matchdays I can be found at Valhalla Pub & Eatery in Charlotte, where fellow Charlotte Reds and
              myself get together to support our club and enjoy a couple of beverages.

            <h4>Word Guess</h4>
            <p>The Word Guess game was the first Javascript assignment we were given. The requirements were to create a
              game similar to hangman. The game required that we take user input, in the form of keystrokes, and
              validated if the user's input matched a letter from the random word that was selected. Being the Liverpool
              fan I am, it was all but certain it was going to be Liverpool themed! This being my first attempt at
              Javascript, I was very proud of the results of this project.</p>

            <h4>RPG Star Wars Game</h4>

            <p>The RPG project, was one of the more challenging assignements we have had. The goal was to create a Star
              Wars themed RPG game. This homework assignment probably took me around 15 hours or so to complete. It was
              a tough one, but I was pleased with the result.</p>

            <h4>Trivia Game</h4>
            <p>The Trivia Game was our first project using Intervals in Javascript. It made for a very interesting
              project. This project didn't take a terribly long time to code the HTML and CSS, especially after having
              figured out how I wanted the site to look. One of the more difficult aspects was keeping track of the
              remaining time, and which answer the user selected based on the button, and then relating that to the
              questions in the Javascript object. I spent more time than I care to admit trying to come up with
              questions for the game.</p>

            <h4>Giftastic</h4>
            <p>
              The Giftastic assignement was an assignment that I really enjoyed, we were given the task of interacting
              with the Giphy API, and retrieving GIFS, via the buttons on the page. There was also a requirement to give
              the user the ability to add buttons as they saw fit, and then fetch GIFS they desired to see. A tricky
              aspect was ensuring that the page counter didn't reset when a different button was clicked, so
              that each time the user selected a button, they always recieved 10 new GIFS.

            <h4>Train Scheduler</h4>
            <p>The purpose of the train scheduler project, was to take user input and stores the information in a
              database (firebase), so that it could be retrieved for later viewing. The page displays the next five
              arrivals of all of the trains within the database and is updated every minute.

            <h4>Group Project 1: Flightplan</h4>
            <p>The goal of the project was to create a website that will find the cheapest flight from the user's
              origin, to their destination, as well as finding events in the area of their destination for the duration
              of their trip. Two APIs were used on this project SkyScanner and Eventbrite. We also used Materialize in
              place of bootstrap for our CSS framework. One of the biggest hurdles we encountered on this project was
              with Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), we ended up having to use the Heroku CORS-proxy to get around
              that particular issue. For the time being.
